# Team32: Skunkworks
- Created a mobile based/web based application for SEWA.ORG.<br/>
- Users considered namely: Volunteers, Admin(Priority Manager), Donors, Help Seekers <br/>
- Technologies used: <br/>
  - ReactJS
  - Python3
  - Flask
  - NodeJS 
  - Docker
  - Kubernetes
  - MySQL 
  <br/>

## Problem statement
- Managing a large group of volunteers has been increasingly challenging for organization leaders <br/>
- Lack of better platform creates difficulties for the Family Support Services program of SEWA to connect to individuals and families in difficult situations <br/>
- Ineffective inter-volunteer communication results in unnecessary delays where quick actions and urgent care is needed <br/>

## The solution: SEWA WebApp
- Help new volunteers to register with SEWA <br/>
- Allows people to submit a request for service or supplies <br/>
- Helps admins to assign cases with specific need to Special Case Managers <br/>
- Notifies volunteers about the requests assigned <br/>

## How it works
1. Person needing help submits a ticket <br/>
2. Admin views the requests received and assigns them to volunteers <br/>
3. Volunteer can view the requests assigned and respond to them as required <br/>
